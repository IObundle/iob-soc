IOb-SoC is a RISC-V-based System-on-Chip Platform written in Verilog, which
users can download for free, modify, simulate and implement in FPGA or ASIC. It
supports stand-alone and boot loading modes, and can use an internal RAM or an
external DDR controller via an L1/L2 cache system. The IP is currently supported
in ASICs and FPGAs. Licensable commercial versions are available.

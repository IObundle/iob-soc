# IOb-SoC

IOb-SoC is a System-on-Chip (SoC) template comprising an open-source RISC-V
processor (picorv32), an internal SRAM memory subsystem, a UART (iob-uart), and
an optional interface to an external memory. If the external memory interface is
selected, an instruction L1 cache, a data L1 cache and a shared L2 cache are
added to the system. The L2 cache communicates with a 3rd party memory
controller IP (typically a DDR controller) using an AXI4 master bus.

## Virtual Machine

IOb-SoC can be run on a VirtualBox VM. This way, the system can be quickly tried
without investing much time installing the tools:

1. Donwload and install [Oracle's VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Download [IOb-SoC VM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gb9O4K4H6fDPyzebjzteXBuiTqnbt2Wi/view?usp=sharing)


## Operating Systems

IOb-SoC can be used in Linux Operating Systems. The following instructions work
for CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 LTS.

## Clone the repository

The first step is to clone this repository. IOb-SoC uses git sub-module trees, and
GitHub will ask for your password for each downloaded module if you clone by *https*. To avoid this,
setup GitHub access with *ssh* and type:
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:IObundle/iob-soc.git
cd iob-soc
```

Alternatively, you can still clone this repository using *https* if you cache
your credentials before cloning the repository, using: ``git config --global
credential.helper 'cache --timeout=<time_in_seconds>'``


## Configure your SoC

To configure your system edit the `config.mk` file, which can be found at the
repository root. This file has the system configuration variables;
hopefully, each variable is explained by a comment.


## Set environment variables for local or remote building and running

The various simulators, FPGA compilers and FPGA boards may run locally or
remotely. For running a tool remotely, you need to set two environmental
variables: the server logical name and the server user name. Consider placing
these settings in your `.bashrc` file, so that they apply to every session.


### Set up the remote simulator server

Using open-source simulator Icarus Verilog as an example, note that in
`hardware/simulation/icarus/Makefile`, the variable for the server logical name,
`SIM_SERVER`, is set to `IVSIM_SERVER`, and the variable for the user name,
`SIM_USER`, is set to `IVSIM_USER`. If you do not set these variables the 
simulator will run locally. To run the simulator on server 
*mysimserver.myorg.com* as user *ivsimuser*, set the following environmental 
variables beforehand:

```Bash
export IVSIM_SERVER=ivsimserver.myorg.com
export IVSIM_USER=ivsimuser
```

### Set up the remote FPGA toolchain and board servers

Using the CYCLONEV-GT-DK board as an example, note that in
`hardware/fpga/quartus/CYCLONEV-GT-DK/Makefile` the variable for the FPGA tool
server logical name, `FPGA_SERVER`, is set to `QUARTUS_SERVER`, and the 
variable for the user name, `FPGA_USER`, is set to `QUARTUS_USER`; the 
variable for the board server, `BOARD_SERVER`, is set to `CYC5_SERVER`, and 
the variable for the board user, `BOARD_USER`, is set to `CYC5_USER`. As in the 
previous example, set these variables as follows:

```Bash
export QUARTUS_SERVER=quartusserver.myorg.com
export QUARTUS_USER=quartususer
export CYC5_SERVER=cyc5server.myorg.com
export CYC5_USER=cyc5username
```

In each remote server, the environment variables for the executable paths and license
servers used must be defined as in the following example:

```Bash
export QUARTUSPATH=/path/to/quartus
export VIVADOPATH=/path/to/vivado
...
export LM_LICENSE_FILE=port@licenseserver.myorg.com;lic_or_dat_file
```


## Simulate the system

To simulate IOb-SoC, the simulator must be installed, either locally or
remotely, and must have a run directory under the `hardware/simulation`
directory, such as the `hardware/simulation/icarus` directory. To simulate,
type:

```
make [sim-run] [SIMULATOR=<simulator directory name>] [<control parameters>]
```

`<simulator directory name>` is the name of the simulator's run directory,

`<control parameters>` are system configuration parameters passed in the
command line, overriding those in the `config.mk` file. Example control
parameters are `INIT_MEM=0 RUN_EXTMEM=1`. For example,
```
make sim-run SIMULATOR=icarus INIT_MEM=0 RUN_EXTMEM=1
```

To visualise simulation waveforms use the `VCD=1` control parameter. It will
open the Gtkwave waveform visualisation program.

To clean simulation generated files, type:
```
make sim-clean [SIMULATOR=<simulator directory name>] 
# Example
make sim-clean SIMULATOR=icarus
```

For more details, read the Makefile in each simulator directory. The Makefile
includes the Makefile segment `simulation.mk`, which contains statements that
apply to any simulator. In turn, `simulation.mk` includes the Makefile segment
`hardware.mk`, which contains targets common to all hardware tools. The 
`hardware.mk` includes `config.mk`,  which contains main system parameters. The
Makefile in the simulator's directory, with the segments recursively included as
described, is construed as a single large Makefile.

## Emulate the system on PC 

If there are embedded software compilation or runtime issues you can
*emulate* the system on a PC to debug the issues. To emulate IOb-SoC's embedded
software on a PC, type:

```
make pc-emul [<control parameters>]
```
where `<control parameters>` are system configuration parameters passed in the
command line, overriding those in the `config.mk` file. Example control
parameters are `INIT_MEM=0 RUN_EXTMEM=1`. For example,
```
make pc-emul INIT_MEM=0 RUN_EXTMEM=1
```

To clean the PC compilation generated files, type:
```
make pc-emul-clean
```

For more details, read the Makefile in the `software/pc-emul` directory. As
explained for the simulation make file, note the Makefile segments recursively
included.


## Build and run on FPGA board

To build and run IOb-SoC on an FPGA board, the FPGA design tools must be
installed, either locally or remotely, the board must be attached to the local
host or to a remote host, and each board must have a build directory under the
`hardware/fpga/<tool>` directory, for example the `hardware/fpga/vivado/BASYS3`
directory. The FPGA tools and board hosts may be different.

To build only, type
``` 
make fpga-build [BOARD=<board directory name>] [<control parameters>]
``` 
where `<board directory name>` is the name of the board's run directory, and
`<control parameters>` are system configuration parameters passed in the command
line, overriding those in the `config.mk` file. For example, 
``` 
make fpga-build BOARD=BASYS3 INIT_MEM=0 RUN_EXTMEM=1
``` 

For more details read the Makefile in the board directory, and follow the
recursively included Makefile segments as explained before.

To build and run, type:
``` 
make fpga-run [BOARD=<board directory name>] [<control parameters>]
``` 

The FPGA is loaded with the configuration bitstream before running. However,
this step is skipped if the bitstream checksum matches that of the last loaded
bitstream, kept in file `/tmp/<board directory name>.load`. If, for some reason,
the run gets stuck, you may interrupt it with `Ctr-C`. Then, you may try again
forcing the bitstream to be reloaded using control parameter `FORCE=1`.

If many users are trying to run the same FPGA board they will be queued in file
`/tmp/<board directory name>.queue`. Users will orderly load their bitstream
onto the board and start running it. After a successful run or `Ctr-C` 
interrupt, the user is de-queued.


To clean the FPGA compilation generated files, type
``` 
make fpga-clean [BOARD=<board directory name>]
``` 

## Compile the documentation

To compile documents, the LaTeX document preparation software must be
installed. Each document that can be compiled has a build directory under the
`document` directory. Currently there are two document build directories:
`presentation` and `pb` (product brief). The document to build is specified by
the DOC control parameter. To compile the document, type:
```
make doc [DOC=<document directory name>]
```


To clean the document's build directory, type:
```
make doc-clean [DOC=<document directory name>]
```

For more details, read the Makefile in each document's directory, and follow the
recursively included Makefile segments as explained before.


## Testing

### Simulation test

To run a series of simulation tests on the simulator selected by the SIMULATOR
variable, type:

```
make sim-test [SIMULATOR=<simulator directory>]
```

The above command produces a test log file called `test.log` in the simulator's
directory. The `test.log` file is compared with the `test.expected` file, which
resides in the same directory; if they differ, the test fails; otherwise, it
passes.

To run the series of simulation tests on all supported simulators, type:

```
make test-sim 
```

To clean the files produced when testing all simulators, type:

```
make test-sim-clean
```


### Board test

To compile and run a series of board tests on the board selected by the `BOARD`
variable, type:

```
make fpga-test [BOARD=<board directory name>]
```

The above command produces a test log file called `test.log` in the board's
directory. The `test.log` file is compared with the `test.expected` file, which
resides in the same directory; if they differ, the test fails; otherwise, it
passes.

To run the series of board tests on all supported boards, type:

```
make test-fpga 
```

To clean the files produced when testing all boards, type:
```
make test-fpga-clean
```



### Documentation test

To compile and test the document selected by the `DOC`, variable, type:

```
make doc-test [DOC=<document directory name>]
```

The resulting Latex .aux file is compared with a known-good .aux file. If the
match the test passes; otherwise it fails.

To test all supported documents, type:

```
make test-doc
```

To clean the files produced when testing all documents, type:
```
make test-doc-clean
```

### Total test

To run all simulation, FPGA board and documentation tests, type:
```
make test
```

## Cleaning

The following command will clean the selected simulation, board and document
directories, locally and in the remote servers:

```
make clean
```



## Instructions for Installing the RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain

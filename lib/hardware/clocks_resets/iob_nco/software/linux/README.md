# IOb NCO Linux Kernel Drivers
- Structure:
    - `drivers/`: directory with linux kernel module drivers for iob_nco
        - `iob_nco_main.c`: driver source
        - `[iob_nco.h]` and `[iob_nco_sysfs.h]`: header files generated by:
        ```bash
        python3 .path/to/iob-linux/scripts/drivers.py iob_nco -o [output_dir]
        ```
        - `driver.mk`: makefile segment with `iob_nco-obj:` target for driver
          compilation
    - `user/`: directory with user application example that uses iob_nco
      drivers
        - `iob_nco_user.c`: example user application that uses iob_nco
          drivers
        - `Makefile`: user application compilation targets
    - `iob_nco.dts`: device tree template with iob_nco node
        - manually add the `nco` node to the system device tree so the
          iob_nco is recognized by the linux kernel

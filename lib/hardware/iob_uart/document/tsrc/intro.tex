The IObundle UART is a RISC-V-based Peripheral written in Verilog, which users
can download for free, modify, simulate and implement in FPGA or ASIC. It is
written in Verilog and includes a C software driver. The IObundle UART is a very
compact IP that works at high clock rates if needed. It supports full-duplex
operation and a configurable baud rate. The IObundle UART has a fixed
configuration for the Start and Stop bits. More flexible licensable commercial
versions are available upon request.
